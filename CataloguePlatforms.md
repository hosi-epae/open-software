# Catalogue of Platforms that facilitate Open Science Software

## Development

Open, colaborative development is typically facilitated by
_source code management (SCM)_ tools, which typically also
bundle _issue/task tracking_ and
_continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)_
features.

Organizations may self-host an SCM, Issue tracking, CI/CD suite
or may rely on public managed services.

Examples of open-source suites for self-hosting include:
- GitLab, https://about.gitlab.com
- Kallithea, self-hosted only: https://kallithea-scm.org

Examples of public managed services include:
- GitLab: https://about.gitlab.com
- GitHub: https://github.com
- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org
- GNU Savannah, only for GPL-licensed projects:
  https://savannah.gnu.org
